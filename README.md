# open-hash
Fork of the code for my file shredding program called open-shred. This time it utilizes certutil to generate a file hash.  This means it only works on Windows for now.

# Installation
<strong>Method 1:</strong> Compile the main.py file into a executable (.exe) file using [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)<br><br>
```pip install pyinstaller```<br><br>
```pyinstaller --onefile main.py```<br><br>
After you complete these set of instructions, the executable should be found in the _dist_ folder <br><br>
<strong>Method 2:</strong> Run the main.py through an IDE or OS command-line that has Python installed
