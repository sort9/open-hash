# open-hash
Fork of the code for my file shredding program called open-shred. This time it utilizes certutil to generate a file hash.  This means it only works on Windows for now.

# Installation
Method 1: Compile the main.py file into a executable (.exe) file using [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/)<br><br>
```pip install pyinstaller```<br><br>
```pyinstaller --onefile main.py```
Method 2: Run the main.py through an IDE or OS command-line that has Python installed
